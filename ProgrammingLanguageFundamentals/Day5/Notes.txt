Polimorphism:
    - Polimorphism can happen when there is more than one object. There is no Polimorphism if there is only object. 

OOP Languages: You use classes.
Procedural Languages: 

Functional Programming: alonzo church is the person known as grandpa of functional programming. He is the person found Lambda calculus. 
    In math there is a concept of function:
            f(x) -> x * x 
    In JS:  var f = (x) => x * x;

        // Idempotent -> same input will give same output
        let total = 0;
        function accumulate(num) { // Not Idempotent
            return total+= num;
        }

        // Pure function: maintains Idempotency
        function accumulate(total, num) {
            return total + num;
        }

        let num = 5;

        // Is is easier to test and maintain pure function

        HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
        - Functions take another function as parameter or return another function as parameter.

        Quote: 
        - If you do OOP do not use switch statement.
        - If you use functional programming, do not use for, while etc. 

RECURSION:
 - Recursion is a functions calls itself.
