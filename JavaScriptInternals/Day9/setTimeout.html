    <!-- There is no way  to run 2 functions at the same time in JavaScript -->

      }

      // Compare this function with timeOut function.
      // This function is JS not WebApi, it blocks the execution of the other functions.
      // The other functions are not allowed to execute and not even postponed.

        console.log("Frozen start");
        longRun(5000);
        console.log("Frozen end");
      }

      // the function below postpone the actions made by longRun, 5 sec after it has been clicked for 5 sec.
      // During setTimeout execution, up and down button does not respond but your clicks are stored and reflected after setTimeout() is done with its work.
      function timeOut() {
        console.log("timeout start");
        setTimeout(longRun, 5000, 10000);

<!-- setTimeout(functionRef, 0) This lets the browser know that the functionRef will be executed after browser is done with its stuff. It will not delay but just wait browser-->
